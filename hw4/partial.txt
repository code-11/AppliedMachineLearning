	We would be able to definitely eliminate all pairs with DogFood and Burgers in them, because even by themselves, they don't have enough counts to meet the minimum support

J
	Support is slightly hared to conceptualize, but counts are not. a minimum support of .1 can be transferred into a minimum count. .1<x/927125
	x>92712.5 so we can know if a itemset has a count of less than 92712 then it will be cut.

	Pairs made from ArtisianTapWater,VitaminCTablets and Ketchup are probably out, although we dont know for sure.Using a bit of domain knowledge, any rare item is likely to not to have a large number of purchases. Although catfood and dog food have a large number of counts, combining them with anything non-pet related will likely (but not definitely) result in a count less than 92712. For instance, {$Grape juice, Catfood, Dogfood$}
